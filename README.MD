# NationCraft Modpack

The official modpack of the NationCraft community, focusing on a balance between technology, magic, and challenging survival gameplay.

There is a strong agricultural and food component (AgriCraft, Pam's HarvestCraft, Spice of Life, & Forestry), a rich progression of technology and automation (Immersive Engineering, MagnetiCraft, Progressive Automation, & MineFactory Reloaded), logic and computer programming (OpenComputers, Project Red, & Project Blue), and a touch of magic (Thaumcraft & Blood Magic) all in a world where the simple joy of architecture and aesthetics is appreciated (Chisel & Carpenter's Blocks).

This is a live modpack that will continually evolve and be tweaked to suit the desires of our community as we evolve with it. It is, eternally, a work in progress.

All feedback is welcome, feel free to post feature requests and suggestions in addition to bug reports on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/GiovanniPorta/NationCraft-Pack/issues).
